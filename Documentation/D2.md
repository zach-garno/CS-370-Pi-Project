## Project Status
This project is currently active. All hardware has been purchased and the Raspberry Pi Zero W (RPi) to motor switch has been assembled.

## Goals:
Device is to be portable, cost effective, fun, and comfortable for the user’s head.

## Use Case:
A common problem with developers commits is they are bloated with several features. This hat addresses this by making commits and pull requests more desirable.

### Impediments:
During our first meeting we discovered that:
 1. The only interface to the RPi was a micro usb. We rewired a usb keyboard with a micro usb to solve this problem. As this is only necessary for manufacturing this will not be included in the cost of the final produce.
 2.To manufacture a switch for the DC motor, we need a diode. This has delayed our implementation of PR feedback via DC motor. We included the diode in our modified parts list below.

## Metrics:
We plan on evaluating the following metrics in order:
* Response Time
  * Experiment: We will be measuring the response time of the device from the time the user preforms a valid action to the time the device is triggered to respond. Valid actions are: local commits, remote pushes, or pull requests. The time the device sends the signal to activate the connected devices.
  * Procedure: We will be preforming a retroactive analysis of the events that occur. Step one is to preform 10 times to a remote branch. We will then record the time the commit was received in the local branch and compare it to the time when then fan motor was turned on.
  * Expected Results: We expect the response time to be on average less than two seconds between the time when a user performs a Github push to when the motor is turned on.
  * Independent Variables:
    * Git is a web service that relies on https protocols and TCP/IP packets through DNS servers and our times to connect to those services could be affected by internet volume, security checks, and availability of the services. While it may be possible to call the GitHub servers directly to bypass the DNS lookup, this should not significantly affect the time to communicate with the services.
    * Repository size and commit size could be a potential factor. When pull requests are accepted, they may be merged in to a large repository which can take longer to complete. Therefore, we will limit our tests to an empty repository. Our commits will always be a three line hello world python script.
* Cost and marketability (A survey with standard questions that contribute to the goal of obtaining the level of interest, user acceptance, and device pricing)
  * Experiment: We will test out product viability by conducting interviews with potential customers such as developers familiar with Github.
  * Procedure: We will talk with the customer and ask if they have had problems with motivation for programming or have had problems with maintaining consistent Github contributions due to forgetting to contribute (forgetting commits or pushes to remote) or due to a dislike Github. Then, we will demonstrate our product and ask for their thoughts. We will evaluate their responses using dichotomous and Likert scales. The Likert scales will be built using current standards according to research using a 5 point scale with the polar labels being delight and frustration.
  * Expected Results: We expect the tests to give us sufficient evidence to conclude our hypothesis where the programming hat is a marketable incentive which helps developers program more and contribute to Github.
  * Independent Variables:
    * The survey will not be peer reviewed and thus subject to a degree of bias. We will however take our best efforts not to ask leading questions and ask the questions in an unbiased order.
    * The survey sample size will likely be small and could contain sampling bias. While we will attempt to survey a variety of professionals, our access to developers within Colorado State University's student body is much more readily available.
* Power consumption (Using standard RPi power statistics to estimate power consumption)
  * Experiment: We will measure the power consumption of the device during a standard American work period of 9 hours (8 hours of working time + an hour lunch break).
  * Procedure: We will measure the power consumption of the device by splicing the power cable which will allow us to measure the current drawn by the raspberry pi, motor, and LEDs. We will then take measurements for idle consumption, consumption during action such as a commit or push to a remote branch.
  * Expected Results: We expect the device to consume 1 watt of power on average because the Raspberry Pi Zero with WIFI draws 0.7W on average. Powering the LEDs and the motor power bursts should average out to be a total power consumption of 1 watt.
  * Independent Variables:
    * Measuring power consumption relies on existing tools that have a degree of error. We will include the error tolerances in our findings.
* Security evaluation (Evaluate any security concerns using published documents for existing methods and hardware. Running a network sniffing tool (wire shark) to determine what, if any information is leaked through network traffic)
  * Experiment: We will evaluate the information the device leaks, and broadcasts during typical use.
  * Procedure: Using wireshark packet analysis to monitor web communications. We will review these packets for any sensitive information leaked
  * Expected Results: We expect no sensitive information to be leaked. Github is mainly an open source platform, code and repository names are largely public, it is also a trusted platform and we expect that we will not find that the service leaks any sensitive information. However, we may find that information transmitted over WIFI between the client and the device may contain sensitive data such as source code or account information such as private security keys and passwords.
  * Independent Variables:
    *Using a third-party tool to evaluate network traffic we will be subject to the practices and accuracy of the software. To mitigate this, we will be using trusted, open source, and peer reviewed software.
    * Security tools are complex and if set up incorrectly will not produce accurate results. In addition to reading documentation we will review several independent sources that reference scenarios specific to our environment to mitigate any platform specific issues.
    * Security is a broad term and should include physical attack vectors. Because our project is geared toward developers, we will assume that the developer follows standard best practices for physical security of the device and will not be evaluated.
