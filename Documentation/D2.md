# Programming Hat (D2 Progress Report)

## Team Members:
* Austin Soriano
* *Casey Key*
* Zach Garno

## Project Status
This project is currently active. All hardware has been purchased and the Raspberry Pi Zero W (RPi) to motor switch has been assembled.
### Impediments:
During our first meeting we discovered that:
 1. The only interface to the RPi was a micro usb. We rewired a usb keyboard with a micro usb to solve this problem. As this is only necessary for manufacturing this will not be included in the cost of the final produce.
 2. The switch purchased required a diod which delayed initial testing. This part is now included in the modified parts list below.

## Metrics:
We plan on evaluating the following metrics in order:
* Response Time ( Time between local commit, remote push, or pull request and recorded output event from the RPi code)
* Cost and marketability ( A servey with standard questions that contribute to the goal of obtaining the level of interest, user acceptance, and device pricing)
* Power consumption (Using standard RPi power statistics to estimate power consumption)
* Security evaluation (Evaluate any security concerns using published documents for existing methods and hardware. Running a network sniffing tool (wire shark) to determine what, if any information is leaked through network traffic)

## Hardware Proof:

## Parts List
* Raspberry Pi Zero W (Ordered from Sparkfun) $10 
* 12 RGB LED’s (Ordered from Sparkfun) $6
* Power bank
* Hat with rotor (Amazon) $16.50
* Light sensor and Flex sensor
* Small DC Motor $4 
* Diod

## Tooling & Development
* micro usb keyboard
* Python 3.8 Framework
* GitHub repository with webhooks enabled
* Bash

## Goals:
Device is to be portable, cost effective, fun, and comfortable for the user’s head.
A common problem with developers commits is they are bloated with several features. This hat addresses this by making commits and pull requests more desirable.
