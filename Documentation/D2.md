# Programming Hat (D2 Progress Report)

## Team Members:

## Project Status
This project is currently active. All hardware has been purchased and the Raspberry Pi Zero W (RPi) to motor switch has been assembled.

## Goals:
Device is to be portable, cost effective, fun, and comfortable for the user’s head.

## Use Case:
A common problem with developers commits is they are bloated with several features. This hat addresses this by making commits and pull requests more desirable.

### Impediments:
During our first meeting we discovered that:
 1. The only interface to the RPi was a micro usb. We rewired a usb keyboard with a micro usb to solve this problem. As this is only necessary for manufacturing this will not be included in the cost of the final produce.
 2. The switch purchased required a diode which delayed initial testing. This part is now included in the modified parts list below.

## Metrics:
We plan on evaluating the following metrics in order:
* Response Time
  * Experiment: We will be measuring the response time of the device from the time the user preforms a valid action to the time the device is triggered to respond. Valid actions are: local commits, remote pushes, or pull requests. The time the device sends the signal to activate the connected devices.
  * Procedure: We will be preforming a retroactive analysis of the events that occure. Step one is to preform 30 valid actions. We will then pull the github logs timestamps and the RPis logs timestamps and compute the average difference to determine action laitency.
  * Expected Results: We expect the results to be less than two seconds from the time a user preforms a valid action to when the device responds.
  * Independent Variables:
    * Git is a web service that relies on https protocols and tcp/ip packets through dns servers and our times to connect to those services could be affected by internet volume, security checks, and availability of the services. While it may be possible to call the GitHub servers directly to bypass the dns lookup, this should not significantly effect the time to communicate with the services.
    * Repository size and commit size could be a potential factor. When pull requests are accepted they are merged which in large repositories and commits could take longer to complete. Because we are not interested in the performance of githubs algorythms we will be limiting the number of lines needed to merge to no more than 20 line changes.
* Cost and marketability (A survey with standard questions that contribute to the goal of obtaining the level of interest, user acceptance, and device pricing)
  * Experiment: We will attempt to determine the end user marketability of our device by surveying a population of developers familure with github.
  * Procedure: Using an anonymous written(digitial or paper) survey with questions pertaining to user acceptance of the device using a veriety of dichotomous and Likert scales. The Likert scales will be built using current standards according to reasearch using a 5 point scale with the polor lables being delight and frustration.
  * Expected Results: We expect the results to revieal that users will be more motivated to preform valid actions, and find programming more enjoyable or whimsicle.
  * Independent Variables:
    * The survey will not be peer reviewed and thus subject to a degree of bias. We will however take our best efforts not to ask leading questions and ask the questions in an unbiased order.
    * The survey sample size will likely be small and could contain sampling bias. While we will attempt to survey a variety of professionals, our access to developers within Colorado State University's student body is much more readily available.
* Power consumption (Using standard RPi power statistics to estimate power consumption)
  * Experiment: We will measure the power consumption of the device during a standard american work period of 9 hours (8 hours of working time + an hour lunch break).
  * Procedure:
  * Expected Results:
  * Independent Variables:
    * Measuring power consumption relies on existing tools that have a degree of error. We will include the error tolerances in our findings.
* Security evaluation (Evaluate any security concerns using published documents for existing methods and hardware. Running a network sniffing tool (wire shark) to determine what, if any information is leaked through network traffic)
  * Experiment: We will evaluate the information the device leaks, and broadcasts during typical use.
  * Procedure: Using wireshark packet analysis to monitor web communications. We will review these packets for any sensitive information leaked
  * Expected Results: We expect no sensitive information to be leaked. Github is mainly an open source platform, code and repository names are largly public, it is also a trusted platform and we expect that we will not find that the service leaks any sensitive information. Sensitive information would be webhook private security keys and passwords.
  * Independent Variables:
    *Using a third-party tool to evaluate network traffic we will be subject to the practices and accuracy of the software. To mitigate this, we will be using trusted, open source, and peer reviewed software.
    * Security tools are complex and if set up incorrectly will not produce accurate results. In addition to reading documentation we will review several independent sources that reference scenarios specific to our environment to mitigate any platform specific issues.
    * Security is a broad term and should include physical attack vectors. Because our project is geared toward developers, we will assume that the developer follows standard best practices for physical security of the device and will not be evaluated.
