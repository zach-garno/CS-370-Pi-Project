# Programming Hat (D2 Progress Report)

## Team Members:

## Project Status
This project is currently active. All hardware has been purchased and the Raspberry Pi Zero W (RPi) to motor switch has been assembled.

## Goals:
Device is to be portable, cost effective, fun, and comfortable for the user’s head.

## Use Case:
A common problem with developers commits is they are bloated with several features. This hat addresses this by making commits and pull requests more desirable.

### Impediments:
During our first meeting we discovered that:
 1. The only interface to the RPi was a micro usb. We rewired a usb keyboard with a micro usb to solve this problem. As this is only necessary for manufacturing this will not be included in the cost of the final produce.
 2.To manufacture a switch for the DC motor, we need a diode. This has delayed our implementation of PR feedback via DC motor. We included the diode in our modified parts list below.

## Metrics:
We plan on evaluating the following metrics in order:
* Response Time (Time between local commit, remote push, or pull request and recorded output event from the RPi code)
  * Independent Variables:
    * Git is a web service that relies on https protocols and tcp/ip packets through dns servers and our times to connect to those services could be affected by internet volume, security checks, and availability of the services. While it may be possible to call the GitHub servers directly to bypass the dns lookup, this should not significantly effect the time to communicate with the services.
* Cost and marketability (A survey with standard questions that contribute to the goal of obtaining the level of interest, user acceptance, and device pricing)
  * Independent Variables:
    * The survey will not be peer reviewed and thus subject to a degree of bias. We will however take our best efforts not to ask leading questions and ask the questions in an unbiased order.
    * The survey sample size will likely be small and could contain sampling bias. While we will attempt to survey a variety of professionals, our access to developers within Colorado State University's student body is much more readily available.
* Power consumption (Using standard RPi power statistics to estimate power consumption)
  * Independent Variables:
    * Measuring power consumption relies on existing tools that have a degree of error. We will include the error tolerances in our findings.
* Security evaluation (Evaluate any security concerns using published documents for existing methods and hardware. Running a network sniffing tool (wire shark) to determine what, if any information is leaked through network traffic)
  * Independent Variables:
    *Using a third-party tool to evaluate network traffic we will be subject to the practices and accuracy of the software. To mitigate this, we will be using trusted, open source, and peer reviewed software.
    * Security tools are complex and if set up incorrectly will not produce accurate results. In addition to reading documentation we will review several independent sources that reference scenarios specific to our environment to mitigate any platform specific issues.
    * Security is a broad term and should include physical attack vectors. Because our project is geared toward developers, we will assume that the developer follows standard best practices for physical security of the device and will not be evaluated.
