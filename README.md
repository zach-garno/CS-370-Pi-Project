# Programming Hat

# Running Software on PI zero Tutorial:
1.) Install ngrok
2.) run ./ngrok http 5000 in the terminal
3.) copy forwarded address and create new webhook with that address + /github
4.) run main.py to start server
5.) ...
6.) profit

## Objective:
To improve a programmer’s performance I propose the programming hat. This hat makes OSS development exciting by flashing lights and spinning a rotor when a pull request is merged to master. Additionally, the hat tracks when the hat is worn, which can effectively be used for measuring programming performance. The programming hat will need a rotor hat, LEDs, light sensor, some sensors, and a Raspberry Pi Zero W. 

## Procedures
* Code will be written in Python
* All code must be reviewed by one other person
  * Note: code reviews are enforced mostly for communication purposes

## Hardware:
* Total: $36.50
* Raspberry Pi Zero W (Ordered from Sparkfun) $10 
* 12 RGB LED’s (Ordered from Sparkfun) $6
* Power bank
* Hat with rotor (Amazon) $16.50
* Light sensor and Flex sensor
* Small DC Motor $4 

## Justification:
The Justification behind each of these items is to be portable, cost effective, fun, and  comfortable for the user’s head. We chose the smallest and most affordable computer we know of with built-in wifi, the Raspberry Pi Zero W. In addition, we found affordable multi-color LEDs which will compliment the fun of the spinning rotor. The rotor will be powered by a simple DC motor. Finally, the rest of the parts are already owned by us which helps to reduce cost. All of this amounts to a cost effective, portable, and fun programming hat.
